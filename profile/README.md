# Golden Child
The communication channel application for children and parent.

## Introduction
Today, there are more and more families having lack of communication between parents and children for various reasons such as dual income. From the child's point of view, even if he or she wants to tell their parents what they have been through for a day, their parents are too busy, so the conversation gradually decreases and eventually leads to a break in conversation. 

Since children are also familiar with using smartphones and applications these days, we thought that using the app would allow parents and children to communicate conveniently even in their busy daily lives. Based on this point, we designed our application where parents and children can communicate through Q&A format, and ultimately, parents can learn more about their children and children can can form a bond with their parents.

2. For the child's answer, the parent user can check the result of sentimental analysis according to the AI model's output.
3. Parent user can receive appropriate audiobook solutions and home appliance services based on their child's sentiment.
4. Parent can see icons on their calendar view that represents the feeling their child has felt every day.

If the parent and child continue to communicate through our app even when they are apart, the topics of conversation will be abundant, which can lead to improved communication.
